# Easy model for classifying FMNIST dataset Images.

## Succesfull:
* Implementing a Dataset class and a Dataloader function for inyecting the data in the model.
* Implementing a model using Sequential class 
* Implemeting a training loop procedure with the following characteristics:
  * l2 regularizer
  * lr scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau)
  * Loss function value and accuracy on test Dataset metrics
